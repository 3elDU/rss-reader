# RSS Reader

A little mobile app aiming at centralizing article reading.

It allows subscribing to RSS feeds, Atom feeds, YouTube channels and Telegram channels (in the future),
and reading all of those in a single place.

This is merely the frontend, and all article fetching and processing is done on the backend,
which is written in Go.

# Roadmap

All of these need to be implemented on the backend first.

## Easy

- [ ] Tags
      Assigning tags to a feed
- [ ] Filtering articles by tags of their feeds
- [ ] Smart tagging
      Using LLMs to assign tags to articles automatically

## Hard

- [ ] In-app article view
